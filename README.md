        <h1>Testing</h1><br>
        <ul>
            <li>I used the chrome extension 'viewport resizer' to test all the different sizes this website
                my apear on. While the viewport automatically changed screen size, I tested the audio, video,
                links, buttons and navigation to check for flaws. The website responded very well with the navbar 
                moving to the top of the web page, and the other divs realigning to mach the vewport size.
                -(this extension tester was recommended by another student)
            </li>
            <li>The form on the events page uses "required" checks and will not submit unless all fields are filled out</li>
        <h4>BUGS</h4>
            <li>there is an interesting bug on this website that i am currently unnable to fix. Some of the different pages of the
                website seem to overflow on the x-axis creating a scroll bar at the bottom of the page which is asthetically annoying.
